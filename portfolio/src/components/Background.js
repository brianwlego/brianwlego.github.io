        <p>I recently graduated from <span className="bold">Flatiron School</span> in NYC where I studied Software Engineering. A few years before that, in 2015, I graduated from <span className="bold">Florida State University</span> with a BFA in Musical Theatre. After FSU, I was fortunate enough to work for Carnival UK & Celebrity Cruises and travel around the world performing for thousands.</p>

        <p>More recently however, I’ve been channelling all my passion into building cool things on the web! I love working with new technologies within web development & collaborating on teams to create exciting and useful applications with great UI.</p>
          
        <p>When I'm not busy clacking away on my laptop you can find me playing tennis &#127934;, singing show tunes 	&#x1f3b6;, or watching reruns of Top Chef  &#128104;&#8205;&#127859;</p>
