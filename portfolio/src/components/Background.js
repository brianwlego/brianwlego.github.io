        <p>A recent graduate from the <span className="bold">Flatiron School</span> in NYC with a concentration in Software Engineering. A few years before that I attended <span className="bold">Florida State University</span> for a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in musical theatre. After FSU, I was fortunate enough to work on cruise ships around the world performing for thousands.</p>

        <p> More recently I've been channelling all my passion into building cool things on the web! I love working within teams and collaborating to create innovative products with great a user interface.</p>
